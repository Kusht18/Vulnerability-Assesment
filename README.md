### Project Description
I conducted a vulnerability assessment for a small business. I evaluated the risks of a vulnerable information system and outlined a remediation plan. process of an organizationâ€™s security systems. You will evaluate the risks of a vulnerable information system and outline a remediation plan.

# System Description

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of the Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.


# Scope

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from March 2023 to May 2023. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.


# Purpose

_The database contains company data which employees regularly access to find new clients. The database stores customer, campaign, and analytic data and it is accessible to the company and the public. If the server was disabled business operations will be impacted as employees will be unable to query data from the server. _

# Approach

Risks considered the data storage and management methods of the business. The likelihood of a threat occurrence and the impact of these potential events were weighed against the risks to day-to-day operational needs.


# Remediation Strategy

Implementing authentication, authorization, and auditing systems can ensure that only authorized users have access to the server. Can do this by creating stronger password requirements and changing passwords after a certain amount of time, implementing the principle of least privilege and MFA. Auditing to ensure that everyone's authorization is up-to-date can prevent current and former employees from becoming threat sources.  Data can be encrypted using TLS instead of SSL. Using IP allow-listing to corporate offices to prevent unknown users from connecting to the database from the internet.
